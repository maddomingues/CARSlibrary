Library with Context-Aware Recommender Systems for Top-N Recommendations


1) DESCRIPTION

The five recommendation algorithms were implemented by using the language R. So, before running the algorithms please install the R environment. Additionally, install the doParallel package to run the experiments in parallel.

Scripts:
ibcf.R - Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) Algorithm
cReduction.R - Combined Reduction Based Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
daviBEST.R - DaVI-BEST Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
filterPoF.R - Weight-PoF Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
weightPoF.R - Weight-PoF Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering


2) HOW TO USE IT?

In the R environment, you must load the R script using the command: source('algorithm.R'). The algorithm run automatically using as input a data file "dataset2.csv". The standard configuration of the algorithms will run them by using 10-fold cross validation.


3) INPUT DATA SET FORMAT

The input data is a text file with several columns separated by the special character " " (space). In the first column we have the user id, in the second one we have the date, in the third column we have the time, the fourth one contains the urls accessed. From the fifth column we have the contextual information. Each column (from the fifth one) represents a specific context. Note that the urls are preceded by "h:" e the contexts by "d:". This tags are necessary for the correct running of the algorithms. In the directory "CARSlibrary" we have an example of input data file ("dataset2.csv").

4) OUTPUT FILES

The R script will output the 10 results (for the 10-fold cross validation) in the directory "result" (Please, create the directory "result", if it does not exist). The algorithms compute the metrics: RECALL, PRECISION, F1, FALLOUT, and MAP.
