Library with Context-Aware Recommender Algorithms for Top-N Recommendations


1) DESCRIPTION

The five recommendation algorithms were implemented by using the language R. So, before running the algorithms please install the R environment. Additionally, install the doParallel package to run the experiments in parallel. Finally, create a directory called "CARSlibrary" e put all the files inside it.

Scripts:
ibcf.R - Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) Algorithm
cReduction.R - Combined Reduction Based Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
daviBEST.R - DaVI-BEST Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
filterPoF.R - Weight-PoF Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
weightPoF.R - Weight-PoF Algorithm using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
runExperiments.R - Auxiliar program to manage the running of the algorithms


2) HOW TO USE IT?

In the R environment, you must load the R script using the command: source('algorithm_name.R'). After that, the algorithm starts automatically using as input a data file "dataset.csv" in the directory "CARSlibrary". The standard configuration of the algorithms will run them by using 10-fold cross validation. However, if you want to run all the algorithms for several data files at the same time, you can setup the input and output directory in the script runExperiments.R, and load it in the R environment with the command source('runExperiments.R').


3) INPUT DATA SET FORMAT

The input data is a text file with several columns separated by the special character " " (space). In the first and second column we have the session and user ids, the third column is used to include additional data (i.e., date, time, etc), the fourth one contains the urls accessed. In the fifth column we have the contextual information. Note that the urls are preceded by "h:" e the contexts by "d:". This tags are necessary for the correct running of the algorithms. The third column is not being used by the algorithms at the moment, but must the filled with some information (e.g., date, time, sequential number, etc). This column will be used for future extensions of this library. In the directory "CARSlibrary" we have an example of input data file ("dataset.csv").

4) OUTPUT FILES

The R script will output the 10 results (for the 10-fold cross validation) in the directory "result" (Please, create the directory "result" inside "CARSlibrary", if it does not exist). The algorithms compute the metrics: RECALL, PRECISION, F1, FALLOUT, and MAP for all algorithms.
